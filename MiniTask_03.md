# Debugging

## IOT Based Smart Security Surveillance Robot debugging tutorial

#### Step 1: First, always check for hardware issues. Check the wiring and make sure all the pins are connected correctly.

#### Step 2: Check to see if the servos are damaged. Typically, a broken servo will have unmeshed gears and will rotate without any resistance.

#### Step 3: Use diode testing mode on the multimeter to check if LEDs are damaged. Replace if damaged.

#### Step 4: Check to see if batteries are dead. Replace with new batteries if dead.

#### Step 5: If all hardware is working properly, then move onto the software debugging and check the code for bugs.
